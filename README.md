## Summary of Class

This course provides students with hands-on experience with blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.
Throughout the course, students will be exposed to weekly lectures introducing blockchain concepts integrated
into five programming assignments. Students analyze underlying blockchain infrastructure including software
architecture, algorithms, security primitives, and decentralization. The hands-on assignments offer practical,
real-world, and open-source blockchain platforms experience with Bitcoin and Ethereum, in addition to an
overview of blockchain technologies and platforms developed within the past few years. Ultimately, the goal
of the course is to provide through lecture and hands-on exercises, and an overall understanding of the Bitcoin
and Ethereum blockchain ecosystem.
